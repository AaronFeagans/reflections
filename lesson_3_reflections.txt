So multiple people can work on the project and download it, as well as using it as a backup.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So you dont risk naming conlficts or getting files you are not familiar with or ready to use.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork copies on GitHub, clones makes a copy of a repository someplace, and branch is a divergent in the repository.
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You are able to work offline.
