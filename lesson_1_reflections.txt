How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
The computer did most of the work but the side by side helped.
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
You are able to see the changes and how a program evolves and can cute out some of the steps in a future program.
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
It adds changes when you think is a logical change, not to often, and not to late. The con is that its up to the user to constantly think about when they need to commit.
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git believes your files are probably interconnected in some way.
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
You can look at the notses input to see what was changed in the log and the specific line.
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Its easy to revert back with no consequences.
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
